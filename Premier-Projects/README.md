## Title: ROAD ACCIDENTS DUE TO DRIVER VIOLATIONS (INDIA)

## Description:
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of state- and union territory-level road accident figures due to driver violations in India. 
It contains details such as the serial number (sno) of the state or UT, its name (stateut), region, number of accidents due to alcohol intake, 
overspeeding, lane jumping, overtaking, driver sleeping and other causes in both years too. 
With such a wealth of information compiled up into one dataset this opens up avenues for researchers to help understand accidents better from preventative measures 
like putting up signage or creating more vigilant road patrols when drivers are known for not adhering to existing speed limits.

<p>
This dataset contains region wise records of road accidents from 2014 to 2016 in India, as a result of driver violations

<ul>
<li>sno: Serial number of the state/UT (Integer)</li>
<li>stateut: Name of the state/UT (String)</li>
<li>region: Region of the state/UT (String)</li>
<li>alcintake2014: Number of accidents due to alcohol intake in 2014 (Integer)</li>
<li>overspeed2014: Number of accidents due to overspeeding in 2014 (Integer)</li>
<li>overtaking2014: Number of accidents due to overtaking in 2014 (Integer)</li>
<li>lanejumping2014: Number of accidents due to lane jumping in 2014 (Integer)</li>
<li>asleep2014: Number of accidents due to sleeping at the wheel in 2014 (Integer)</li>
<li>othercause2014: Number of accidents due to miscellaneous causes in 2014 (Integer)</li>
<li>alcintake2016: Number of accidents due to alcohol intake in 2016 (Integer)</li>
<li>overspeed2016: Number of accidents due to overspeeding in 2016 (Integer)</li>
<li>lanejumping2016: Number of accidents due to lane jumping in 2016 (Integer)</li>
<li>overtaking2016: Number of accidents due to overtaking in 2016 (Integer)</li>
<li>asleep2016: Number of accidents due to sleeping at the wheel in 2016 (Integer)</li>
<li>othercause2016: Number of accidents due to miscellaneous causes in 2016 (Integer)</li>
</ul>

## Research Ideas:
<ul>
<li>Visualizing regional trends of driver-related accidents to identify high-risk areas for targeted public awareness campaigns.</li>
<li>Utilizing the data to develop predictive models that can forecast driver violation risks for specific regions, allowing law enforcement agencies to better allocate resources in affected areas.</li>
<li>Creating an integrated dashboard with interactive maps and charts that can be accessed by members of the public or law enforcement personnel, displaying real-time insights on the number of road accidents due to driver violations in a particular region or state/UT</li>
</ul>
<br>

## What to do:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the data by state/UT to get an overview of the accidents that occurred.</li>
<li>Utilize the ‘State/UT’ and ‘region’ columns to match your specific location and determine the types of violations commonly observed in your area.</li>
<li>Draw comparison between data by comparing accident numbers triggered due to alcohol intake, overspeeding, overtaking, lane jumping & sleeping while driving etc., in order to identify whether compliance with safety rules has improved or worsened over time.</li>
<li>Group together states/ UTs which have similar accident numbers for different driver violations over a period of two years; this will help you understand areas where similar actions need to be taken by authorities for better enforcement of laws and thereby reduce road accidents due to driver negligence in those regions.</li>
<li>Figures out which states are more prone to certain type of violation as compared others across India such during same period by plotting graphs for overall performance or per-state performance against each criteria such as alcohol intake, speed etc.</li>
</ul>
